My Video is in the google drive that I shared earlier!!

The Wavelength‐Style Guessing Game is a pure-Python, command-line adaptation of a party game in which players have to discover a secret number on a range by means of a single hint word. The game offers four modes: Easy, where the players determine their own number of rounds and receive directional hints ("a little higher" or "a little lower") after each guess; Medium, which fixes the number of rounds at five and preserves the hint feedback; Harvard, which offers three rounds and offers only correct or incorrect for each guess; and Two-Player, where one user hosts a simple TCP server to define the spectrum labels, clue, and secret number and the second user connects as a client to make guesses while the host responds to each guess with yes or no.
The code is divided into separate modules for readability and modularity. config.py holds the spectrum range and number of rounds settings. clue_database.py contains the full list of spectra, clue words, and corresponding numeric positions from one to ten. utils.py contains utility functions for selecting a random secret, maintaining a persistent wins and losses scoreboard, and reading or writing JSON data. game_modes.py has the gameplay loops for single-player Easy, Medium, and Harvard modes. two_player_server.py and two_player_client.py handle the host and joiner sides over TCP sockets for head-to-head play. wavelength_game.py is the only entrypoint, presenting a menu for users to choose their mode and then sends gameplay to the appropriate module.
To run the game, clone or download the repository to a local machine with Python 3.7 or newer installed. No external packages or API keys are required; all functionality uses Python’s standard library. From within the project folder (the one containing wavelength_game.py and its supporting modules), simply execute
python3 wavelength_game.py
You will see a prompt to choose Easy, Medium, Harvard, Two-Player, or Quit. Easy and Medium modes will ask for any inputs necessary (custom rounds for Easy) and guide you through guessing the secret number from one to ten, giving hints or direct feedback as needed. Harvard mode will limit you to three guesses with check-or-cross feedback only. For Two-Player mode, choose Host or Join first: hosts offer a listening port, secret number, low and high spectrum labels, and a clue word, and wait for the client; joiners input the host's IP and port, get the spectrum and clue right away, and begin guessing as host's yes/no responses advance the game toward completion. Wins and losses in the single-player modes also are saved automatically to a scoreboard.json file in the same folder that you can delete if you wish to reset your stats. If you receive errors that it cannot find modules, ensure you're executing the script from the directory containing all the.py files. If the client gets a connection refused in Two-Player mode, ensure that the host has passed all the prompts and is displaying "Waiting for player to connect…" before attempting to connect as the client, and that you are using the loopback address (127.0.0.1) or right LAN IP.
To make my code more efficient and work within fewer lines, I first wrote a full version by hand and then used generative AI to condense some of the longer functions and redundant areas. This maintained the code fully operational on my PC and eliminated lag that was being created by an overly long script.
